        <h2>Italian Chicken Cutlets</h2>
            <p>New Yorkers fucking love chicken cutlets. To the point where they'll literally name a restaurant after them, and that's all they sell. So why the hell wouldn't I include this in my project?</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>olive oil for frying, enough to fill pan at least 1-inch high</li>
                <li>1 pound (454g) chicken cutlets thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (65g) flour for dredging only</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal Kosher salt divided</li>                       
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>                    
                <li>3 large eggs beaten</li>
                <li>1 cup (100g) Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons minced Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (23g) grated Pecorino Romano</li>
                <li>1 large lemon cut into wedges, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Set up a frying station with 3 bowls or baking dishes. In the first large bowl, combine the flour with half of the salt
                and pepper. In a second large bowl beat the eggs. Finally, in the third large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Pecorino,
                parsley, and remaining salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Dredge dry chicken cutlets into flour, shake off excess and place into eggwash. Make sure egg completely coats the flour
                and bring it out of the bowl allowing excess to drip off. Place the chicken into the breadcrumbs. Coat on both sides and
                set the breaded chicken cutlets onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Pour oil 1-inch high into large cast iron or heavy pan and heat until the temp reaches 360f.</li>
                <li>Fry chicken cutlets for 3-4 minutes per side. Work in batches and do not crowd. When cutlets finish cooking set on wire
                rack or plate lined with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Serve chicken cutlets by themselves or with an arugula salad or lemon wedges. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
